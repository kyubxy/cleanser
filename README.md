Do you also like swearing in comments but hate the idea of getting expelled from your uni for leaving in a bad word in one of your assignments by accident (hey, it's really hard to control what you say on those late nights). Fear not, just run your code through this python script and rest assured any profanities, no matter how gut wrenching terrible, will be picked up and brought to your attention.
